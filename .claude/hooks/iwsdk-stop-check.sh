Before finishing, please go through this checklist:

## 1. Runtime Verification
Did you verify your changes work at runtime? If you modified any packages or examples,
use the mcp-call.mjs script to test against a running dev server:

  node scripts/mcp-call.mjs --port <PORT> --tool browser_screenshot
  node scripts/mcp-call.mjs --port <PORT> --tool get_console_logs
  node scripts/mcp-call.mjs --port <PORT> --tool ecs_list_systems
  node scripts/mcp-call.mjs --port <PORT> --tool ecs_list_components

If a dev server is running, take a screenshot and check console logs at minimum.
If no dev server is running and your changes are code-only (not runtime), that's OK — just confirm.

## 2. Code Quality
Run these and fix any issues:
  - `pnpm format` (Prettier formatting)
  - `pnpm lint` (ESLint)
  - `pnpm build` (TypeScript compilation / type checking)

## 3. MCP Tool Feedback
If during this session you used the mcp-call.mjs script (or wished you could) and have
any feedback about the MCP tools — missing tools, confusing APIs, tools that didn't work
as expected, or tools you wish existed — please append your feedback to:

  .claude/mcp-feedback.jsonl

Use this format (one JSON object per line):
  {"timestamp": "<ISO 8601>", "session": "<brief task description>", "tool": "<tool_name or 'general'>", "type": "<missing|bug|improvement|wish>", "feedback": "<your feedback>"}

If you have no MCP feedback, skip this step.

## 4. Confirm
After completing the above (or confirming they're not applicable), you may finish.
